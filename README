Tpm is a general package manager designed for every linux distro out there. Currently it is not in a functional stage, although most of it works (It just needs to be implemented for each distro, which will hopefully be pushed to me).

I plan on using gpg for the package signing when this is implemented for Arch Linux, iirc Arch does not have this. Implemation for each distro will be in a distro.py format that will be imported automatically.
This currenltly uses a tpm_daemon as the torrent client. The server.py is for the actual server running opentracker. tpm.py is what the client will be using to download package lists, etc...

I plan on having this integrate with pacman/yaourt, apt-get, yum, etc... to provide minimal changes to the end user. 

Current deps are libtorrent, Twisted, and Pyro
